# Get It Done!
Web Programming Final Project


Due to the fast-paced generation, everyone’s schedule may not match up, even when living under one roof. This makes it difficult to communicate in households. Certain chores and tasks need to be complete around the house but distributing and confirming they are complete can be difficult to coordinate. For example, if my mom thinks I cleaned the bathrooms, but I assumed she had cleaned the bathrooms and neither of us clean the bathrooms. This will leave the bathrooms uncleaned. Vice versa, if my mom cleans the bathrooms but I was not aware that she cleaned them, I would reclean them for no reason. Another scenario where schedule coordination and communication are an issue is at a school, college, or workplace. In this case, doing a group project is difficult when trying to coordinate around everyone’s schedules. 

To solve this issue, the website Get It Done! is perfect. Get It Done! is a website where families, or a group of individuals, can coordinate tasks that need to be done. The group, or an individual leader, can create a user with the following information: a name, email, username, and password. Then, the group may share the username and password to everyone. Then everyone will login with the same username and password to the website. Inside the website, they can see current tasks and add tasks. When adding a task, they input the task name, a description to explain the task, and an optional due date in case there is a deadline. 

To make this solution, I will be using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and a Firebase Database.
